## `useQrcode`

Much like the `Qrcode` component, the `useQrcode` composable only requires a single `value` argument to work.

What makes it different is that we also have a `toBase64` property, which, when set to `true`, will return a base64 encoded string of the QRCode image.


:component-example{name="use-qrcode-base64"}

::warning
When encoding QRCode images to base64, the `blackColor` and `whiteColor` will fallback to `#000` and `#FFF` respectively if it cannot find the related CSS variables (e.g. when using Nuxt UI and generating QRCodes from an API handler).

## Reactivity

The `useQrcode` composable is reactive, meaning that if you change the `value` or any of the options, the QRCode will automatically update.
